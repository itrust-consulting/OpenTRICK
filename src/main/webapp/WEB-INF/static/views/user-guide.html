		<li>Uncertainty: Checkbox to indicate if you want to take account of the uncertainty of assessments. Several features, specific
			to uncertainty will be added to the risk analysis if the checkbox is ticked.</li>
		<li>Impacts: Select the impact scales that you wish to import into the risk analysis. The default is to use the same impact
			scales as in the profile (“From profile”).</li>
		<li>Level: Specify the number of levels that shall be used for the impact and probability scales in the analysis. This option
			cannot be changed if “From profile” is selected in the list above, since in that case the level from the profile is considered.</li>
		<li>Max impact: Specify the maximum value for the quantitative impact scale. This option cannot be changed if “From profile”
			is selected in the list above, since in that case the maximum from the profile is considered. Note that the value provided
			here is only used to initialise the scale with default values; you can fully change the scale afterwards.</li>

	<h3 id="new-profile">New profile</h3>
	<p>With the “New profile” button, you can create a new profile based on the selected risk analysis. A profile can be reused
		as basis to create new risk analysis. The list of available profiles can be found in the knowledge base (see <a href="#impacts">[Section]</a>)</p>
	<p>Note that no sensitive data are copied to a profile. The risk scenarios defined in the selected risk analysis will be taken
		over and the user has the possibility to choose which security measures collection should be included in the new profile:</p>
	<p>After providing a name to the profile to create, you can add the new profile to the knowledge base by clicking on “Save”
		the button.</p>

	<h3 id="export">Export</h3>
	<p>With the “Export” button, you can export the selected risk analysis. The exported file is an SQLite database file including
		all data of the risk analysis. The exported file can be used as backup or to import it in another TRICK Service instance
		(e.g.: locally installed TRICK Service).</p>
	<h3 id="export-report">Export report</h3>
	<p>The “Export report” button is a short-hand method to generate the exhaustive Word report for the selected analysis. This
		button is equivalent to opening the analysis, and exporting the report from within the analysis.</p>
	<h3 id="delete">Delete</h3>
	<p>You can delete a risk analysis by selecting the risk analysis and clicking on the “Delete” button.</p>

		you have been granted permission.</p>
	<h3 id="my-sqlites"><a id="account-sqlite"></a>My sqlites</h3>
	<p>When exporting a risk analysis from TRICK Service, a copy of the exported SQLite file is stored on the server hosting TRICK
		Service. This has several reasons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you want to download again a SQLite file of a risk analysis, you can do this without having to re-compute a dump of
			an analysis.</li>
		<li>You have an overview of all exports done in the past.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As mentioned you can download or delete the SQLite files of the list by clicking on the buttons within the action column.</p>
	<h3 id="my-reports"><a id="account-report"></a>My reports</h3>
	<p>As for the “My sqlite” section (see <a href="#my-sqlites">[Section]</a>), you can find in the “My reports” section a list of all exported risk analysis reports. When exporting a
		word report, a copy of the report is stored on the server hosting TRICK Service. This has several reasons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you want to download again a report, you can do this without having to re-compute a word export.</li>
		<li>You have an overview of all reports exported in the past.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You have the option to delete a report or to download it again by clicking on the corresponding buttons in the action column.</p>

		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Sign-in settings for enabling Two-Factor Authentication.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>In the sign-in settings you can enable or disable the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for your account.</p>
	<p>When you enable 2FA by clicking the respective button, all subsequent logins will require you to confirm your identity by
		enforcing you to enter a security code that is sent to your e-mail address. See <a href="#two-factor-authentication-2fa">[Section]</a> for further details on the Two-Factor Authentication process.</p>
	<h4>Enabling 2FA for mobile devices</h4>
	<p>When you additionally enable the “Use mobile application” feature, you additionally have the option to enter a one-time
		password when you log in, that is generated each time by your mobile device.</p>
	<p>The procedure to enable 2FA for your mobile consists in the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Enable two factor authentication by clicking the “Enable” button.</li>
		<li>Enable “Use mobile application” by clicking the “Enable” button.</li>
		<li>Install an application that supports the TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) protocol from the app store of your device.

	<h3 id="parameters"><a id="analysis-parameter"></a>Parameters</h3>
	<p>The parameters page includes the labels of probability/impact scales, the risk acceptance threshold (for qualitative risk
		analysis), CSSF parameters, various parameters and security maturity related parameters.</p>
	<h4>Labels of probability/impact scale</h4>
	<p>This section allows the user to define the (short) labels for the different probability and impact scales used in the risk
		analysis. The labels are used throughout the risk analysis and the report. They are meant to be synonymous with the actual
		level value.</p>
	<h4>Risk acceptance threshold (Qualitative risk analysis)</h4>
	<p>The risk acceptance threshold is used to indicate the different levels of risks and what reaction is expected for risks
		of this level.</p>
	<figure id="_FIG_47" class="figure">
		<img src="img/49.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Risk acceptance threshold.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>By clicking on the “Manage” button, the user can define different importance thresholds. By clicking on the “+” button,
		the user can add a new threshold. For each new threshold level, the user should indicate a label (name of the threshold,
		e.g. critical, high, medium, low), the upper limit of the threshold value, a description of the threshold indicating what
		should be done with risks associated with this level and a colour used in the risk heat map (see <a href="#charts">[Section]</a>).</p>
	<figure id="_FIG_48" class="figure">
		<img src="img/50.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Risk acceptance threshold management.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<h4>Various parameters</h4>
	<p>The options of the “Various parameters” table are the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Internal setup rate: Average cost of one internal man-day. Used to compute implementation costs of security measures.</li>
		<li>External setup rate: Average cost of one external man-day. Used to compute the implementation costs of security measures.</li>
		<li>Default lifetime: Default lifetime of a security measure before it must be re-implemented. When ever you do not enter a
			value for the lifetime of a security measure, TRICK Service will consider the default lifetime specified here, instead.</li>
		<li>Max RRF (only for quantitative analyses): Used to fine-tune the Risk Reduction Factor (RRF). The Max RRF value is expressed
			in percentage. The RRF will be multiplied with the MAX RRF value to fine-tune the RRF.</li>
		<li>SOA: Used to only consider measure with implementation rate &lt; SOA for the SOA section. If an ISO 27002 security measure
			has an implementation rate that is higher than the SOA threshold parameter, the security measure is sufficiently implemented
			to fulfil the ISO/IEC 27001 minimum requirements.</li>
		<li>Mandatory phase: Option to define a phase in which all security measures become mandatory to be implemented.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Security maturity related parameters</h4>
	<h5>Maximal efficiency rate per security maturity level</h5>
	<p>Finally, we can modify three tables regarding maturity level. The first maturity parameter table contains maximal efficiency
		rates associated with different security maturity levels. The following figure shows default values for these parameters.</p>
	<figure id="_FIG_49" class="figure">
		<img src="img/51.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Maximal efficiency rate per security maturity level.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<h5>Implementation scale of SMT</h5>
	<p>The second maturity parameter table contains a scale for measuring the implementation rate of the different tasks in the
		different security maturity levels. The following figure shows the default values for these parameters.</p>
	<figure id="_FIG_50" class="figure">
		<img src="img/52.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Implementation scale of SMT.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<h5>Required level of implementation per SML</h5>
	<p>The last maturity parameter table contains an overview on all tasks related to the different security maturity levels and
		indicates the needed implementation rate of the tasks to be compliant with a certain security maturity level. The following
		figures show default values for these parameters.</p>

	<h4>Probability scale</h4>
	<p>The probability scale for quantitative risk analysis:Each level represents the yearly probability that a risk may occur.
		The values may be edited, depending on the preferences of the organisation on how to define the different probability levels
		(see figure below).</p>

	<p>For identifying risks, TRICK Service offers the possibility to perform a brainstorming on most common threats, vulnerabilities,
		and risk specificities. Based on the results of the brainstorming, it is easier to focus on domains where a high exposure
		level has been identified.</p>
	<p>Following the basic principle of TRICK Service, only table cells that are highlighted in blue are editable. Each section
		contains a table containing 6 columns which are described below.</p>
	<table class="table table-sm table-striped" id="_TAB_2">

	<h3 id="risk-assessment">Risk assessment</h3>
	<h4><a id="analysis-asset"></a>Assets</h4>
	<p>The assets section contains a table listing all assets that are within the scope of the risk assessment. In the ribbon above
		the asset table, the user has the following options: Add, Edit, Select, Unselect, and Delete.</p>
	<h5>Adding an asset</h5>
	<p>If there are no assets in the table already, the only option available to the user will be “Add”. To add an asset to the
		list, click on the “Add” button which will open the box seen in the figure below.</p>
	<figure id="_FIG_55" class="figure">
		<img src="img/58.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Add new asset.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>The following information related to each asset should be indicated when adding an asset:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Name: the name of the asset;</li>
		<li>Type: select from a drop-down list one of the following asset types:
			<ul>
				<li>Business process;</li>
				<li>Compliance;</li>
				<li>Financial;</li>
				<li>Hardware;</li>
				<li>Information;</li>
				<li>Immaterial Value;</li>
				<li>Network;</li>
				<li>Service;</li>
				<li>Employees;</li>
				<li>Software.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Value: The asset value in k€;</li>
		<li>Status: Select or unselect an asset to be considered for the risk analysis;</li>
		<li>Comment: A comment regarding the asset e.g. a justification of its value, etc.;</li>
		<li>Hidden comment: A comment regarding the asset which will not be displayed in the final report.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Once all mandatory information is filled in (comments are not mandatory), click on the “Save” button, to add the asset to

	<h5>Editing an asset</h5>
	<p>Editing an asset can be done in two different ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Double-click on the asset in the table to open the box indicated in <a href="#_FIG_55">[Figure]</a>. The box will contain all the information that was previously entered and can be directly edited before re-saving
			using the “Save” button.</li>
		<li>Select the asset by ticking the box to the left-hand side of the required asset. The “Edit asset” option in the ribbon
			will now be highlighted in blue, allowing to click on it to open the information box.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Select and unselect</h5>
	<p>The “Select” and “Unselect” buttons are used to select which assets are to be included in the computation. Ticking the box
		next to an asset and then clicking the relevant “Select” or “Unselect” button will either include or exclude the asset
		from the risk analysis (it will not be displayed during risk estimation). If an asset in the list has a green background,
		it is included. If it has a white background, it is excluded from the computation. An orange background indicates that
		no asset value has been indicated (which is optional and not needed for risk computation).</p>
	<h5>Deleting an asset</h5>
	<p>To delete an asset, select the asset by ticking the box next to it on the left-hand side. Once the box is ticked, click
		the “delete” button in the ribbon to delete the asset from the list. All the assets in the list can be deleted together
		by ticking the box at the top of the far-left column to select all assets and then clicking “Delete”.</p>
	<h4><a id="analysis-scenario"></a>Scenarios</h4>
	<p>The scenarios table contains information regarding the different scenarios which will be considered for the risk analysis.

		risk scenarios and the influence of the security measures on risks of the current risk analysis.</p>
	<figure id="_FIG_75" class="figure">
		<img src="img/79.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Import of risk specificity values.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<h4>Import RRF</h4>
	<p>The import RRF option allows the user to import the RRF values from a risk analysis profile or from another customer. First
		the user has to select from which profile/ customer and from which analysis he likes to import the RRF values and second
		he has to select for which standard he wants to copy the values.</p>
	<figure id="_FIG_76" class="figure">
		<img src="img/80.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Change impact scales.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Once the user selected a profile and a standard, he can import the RRF values defined in the profile for the selected standard
		to the current analysis. Note that the RRF values of the standard in the current analysis will be overwritten by the RRF
		values from the standard of the analysis profile.</p>
	<h4>Import (Raw)</h4>
	<p>With the help of the Import (Raw) option, the user can import and overwrite the RRF values of the selected risk analysis.
		The import file must be under Microsoft Excel format and correspond to the format of the exported (raw) data file.</p>
	<h4>Export (Raw)</h4>
	<p>The export (raw) option allows to export all RRF values of the different standards in Microsoft Excel format. This allows
		the user to modify more fast several RRF values. With the help of the Import (Raw) option, the user can reimport and overwrite
		the RRF values of the selected risk analysis.</p>
	<h3 id="edit-text-fields">Edit text fields</h3>
	<p>You can choose between “open” or “close” edit modes to open or close all text fields of the selected risk analysis.</p>
	<h3 id="settings--">Settings</h3>
	<h4>Manage statement of applicability</h4>
	<p>Shows a pop-up which permits the user to enable/disable the statement of applicability for the several security standards.
		If the statement of applicability is disabled for all standards, it will be hidden throughout the risk analysis.</p>
	<h4>Manage impact scales</h4>
	<p>Shows a pop-up that allows the user to select all the impact scales (quantitative and qualitative) that shall be available
		in the risk analysis.</p>
	<p>If only the quantitative impact is included, then the analysis type will turn into “quantitative”, and all qualitative-related
		options will be removed.</p>
	<p>If only quantitative impact scales are included, then the analysis type will turn into “qualititative”, and all quantitative-related
		options will be removed.</p>
	<p>If both qualitative and quantitative impact scales are included, then the analysis type will turn into “mixed”, and all
		options will be available in the risk analysis.</p>
	<div class="alert alert-danger">Removing an impact scale will permanently delete all associated risk estimations! It is strongly recommended to create a
		backup or a new version of the risk analysis before deleting impact scales!</div>
	<h4>Manage scale levels</h4>
	<p>Shows a pop-up (see <a href="#_FIG_76">[Figure]</a>) where the user can change the impact and probability scales.The dialog features two columns: the left hand-side
		displays the currently defined levels in the risk analysis (in the example: 3). The right hand-side contains the new levels.
		Click the “+” button to add an additional level to the scale. Drag an old level from the left and drop it onto a level
		on the right. All levels dropped onto a new level will be replaced by the latter.</p>
	<figure id="_FIG_77" class="figure">
		<img src="img/81.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Exit symbol.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<h4>Advanced settings</h4>
	<p>Opens a dialog where advanced options can be shown or hidden for the risk analysis:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Show raw estimation: shows the RAW risk estimations in the risk sheets ( <a href="#risk-assessment">[Section]</a>).</li>
		<li>Show hidden comments: displays the “hidden comment” in the risk sheets ( <a href="#risk-assessment">[Section]</a>). This field was used in old TRICK Service versions, and is hidden by default in more recent releases.</li>
		<li>Show dynamic analysis: enables the use of dynamic parameters in the risk analysis for the sake of real-time risk monitoring.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="close-analysis">Close analysis</h2>

	<p>By clicking on the Exit symbol, the current risk analysis will be closed and the user will be redirected to the “Analysis” <a href="#analysis">[Section]</a>. This option allows the user to close the current analysis without logging out of the application.</p>

	<h1 id="annex-b-api">Annex B – API</h1>
	<p>TRICK Service includes an HTTP/ReST API for providing external risk input to risk analyses, making them thus dynamic. External
		input is available as named parameters in a risk assessment, more precisely, in the “probability” field of every risk assessment.</p>
	<h2 id="use">Use</h2>
	<p>Before the API can be accessed, a dedicated “IDS user” needs to be created and enabled via the Administration interface
		(see <a href="#ids">[Section]</a> for details). By default, the newly created IDS user does not have access to any risk analysis. In the risk
		analysis overview, click on “Manage IDS” (see <a href="#manage-ids">[Section]</a>) and select the IDS users you wish to subscribe to. Every risk analysis that is subscribed to an IDS user,
		gets automatically updated when the IDS reports to the TRICK Service API. Put differently, when an IDS updates dynamic
		parameters via the API, all risk analyses that have subscribed to this IDS will update their corresponding copies of the
		dynamic parameters to the given values.If you wish that dynamic parameters should no longer be updated for a certain risk
		analysis, unsubscribe from the respective IDS user via the “Manage IDS” interface (see <a href="#manage-ids">[Section]</a>).</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info">For performance reasons, the dynamic parameters are only updated once every 900 seconds (15 minutes). More precisely, if
		a value is reported via the API, it is first checked if an update of the dynamic parameters is already scheduled. If yes,
		nothing happens (the value will be handled in the scheduled update), otherwise an update is scheduled after 900 seconds.
		In particular, the dynamic parameters will only be updated 900 seconds after the first API call.</div>
	<h2 id="http-requests">HTTP requests</h2>
	<p>API calls are made using secured HTTPS requests to TRICK Service. If TRICK Service is running on e.g.
		<code>https://trickservice.itrust.lu</code>, then the API calls should be made (usually via POST) to
		<code>https://trickservice.itrust.lu/Api/&lt;method_name&gt;</code>, where the available method names are listed below.Every HTTP request must have the following HTTP headers set:</p>
	<pre>Accept: application/json;charset=UTF-8 <br />Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8 <br />X-Auth-Token: &lt;api_token&gt;</pre>
	<p>Above,
		<code>&lt;api_token&gt;</code> should be replaced by the API token that is displayed in the IDS administration ( <a href="#ids">[Section]</a>). It is this token that is responsible for the authentication.The actual HTTP request body must be encoded
		in JSON. See the sections below for more details.</p>
	<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
	<p>The TRICK Service exposes methods which can be accessed using a HTTP client as described below. Parameters are passed to
		the API in the HTTP request body in JSON format (using the “application/json;charset=utf-8” encoding).The supported methods
		are explained in the following subsections.</p>
	<h3 id="setting-dynamic-parameters">Setting dynamic parameters</h3>
	<p>This method defines a new dynamic parameter that can be used in risk assessments.This method is called with HTTP “POST”
		and is available at
		<code>/Api/ids/set</code>.The expected parameters are of the form</p>
	<pre>{ &quot;data&quot;: [ <br /> { &quot;c&quot;: &lt;category&gt;, &quot;t&quot;: &lt;time&gt;, &quot;v&quot;: &lt;value&gt; }, <br /> ... <br />] }</pre>
	<p>for arbitrarily many elements. The placeholders are to be replaced according to the table below.</p>
	<table class="table table-sm table-striped">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Placeholder</th>
				<th>JSON data type</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>&lt;category&gt;</td>
				<td>String</td>
				<td>The name of the dynamic parameter to create/update.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>&lt;time&gt;</td>
				<td>Integer</td>
				<td>The timestamp when the parameter shall obtain the value. In most cases this value is
					<code>now()</code>. The timestamp is expressed as the number of seconds since 1 January 1970, 00:00:00 UTC (often called “UNIX timestamp”).
				</td>

			<tr>
				<td>&lt;value&gt;</td>
				<td>Floating point</td>
				<td>The ‘value’ of the parameter as a floating point number at the specified &lt;timestamp&gt;.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Each line defines a parameter which has the given value starting from the given time and until the next timestamp for which
		a value was defined. For instance, if the API receives two requests that define (c=demo, t=0, v=5) and (c=demo, t=3600,
		v=10), then the parameter “demo” has the value 5 between 12:00am and 1:00am, and the value 10 starting from 1:00am.</p>
	<h3 id="reporting-ids-notifications">Reporting IDS notifications</h3>
	<p>This method accepts notifications (alerts) from external sources (such as intrusion detection systems) from which TRICK
		Service computes a risk level (from 0 to 1) that is available as a dynamic parameter in risk assessments. Each alert will
		raise the risk level: the higher the severity (see below), the higher the risk level will be raised. The risk level will
		slowly decrease with time (in an exponential fashion) again: the half-life (see below) of the alert affects how fast it
		will decrease.This method is called with HTTP “POST” and is available at
		<code>/Api/ids/notify</code>. The expected parameters are of the form</p>
	<pre>{ &quot;data&quot;: [ <br /> { &quot;c&quot;: &lt;category&gt;, &quot;t&quot;: &lt;time&gt;, &quot;h&quot;: &lt;halflife&gt;, &quot;s&quot;: &lt;severity&gt;, &quot;n&quot;: &lt;number&gt; }, <br /> ... <br />] }</pre>
