	<div class="alert alert-info">Depending on your access rights, not all options will be visible for you.</div>
	<p>The following sub-chapters further explain the contents of the different navigation tabs.</p>
	<h2 id="knowledge-base">Knowledge base</h2>
	<p>The Knowledge base is split into the following 5 sections:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Customers;</li>
		<li>Analyses language;</li>
		<li>Measures collections;</li>
		<li>Impacts;</li>
		<li>Analysis profiles.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The meaning and functionalities concerning those 5 sections will be explained in the following subsections.</p>
	<h3 id="customers"><a id="knowledgebase-customer"></a>Customers</h3>
	<p>This table contains a list of customer details which can be stored for reference. Information regarding customers can be
		added, edited, and deleted using the options in the navigation at the top of the table.</p>
	<figure id="_FIG_11" class="figure">
		<img src="img/13.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">List of customers.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>For adding a new customer, click on the “Add” button. All information fields must be filled out, including the company name,

	<figure id="_FIG_12" class="figure">
		<img src="img/14.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Add new customer.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>For editing or deleting a customer, you must select the customer and click on the appropriate button (“Edit” or “Delete”).</p>
	<p>Customers have report templates associated to them. These templates serve as a base for the exported reports for risk analyses associated to that customer. Click “Manage customer report templates” to open a dialog for managing them.</p>
	<figure id="_FIG_12b" class="figure">
		<img src="img/mcrt.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Manage the report templates for a customer.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>In the “Manage customer report templates” dialog, a list of all available templates is presented. At the top of the list, the default templates deployed with OpenTRICK are listed; these cannot be edited or deleted. Below, custom templates are listed. To add a template, click the “Add” button.</p>

		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Add or edit a report template for a customer.</figcaption><i-- updated, there was no mixed analysis option-->
	</figure>
	<p>In that dialog, you need to specify a type and a language. These specify to which risk analyses the template applies to; the template will only be available for export if the type and language match. The version that is specified is used to check if the template is outdated, or not. If the version specified here corresponds to the version of the template deployed by default, then it is considered to be up to date. Otherwise, it is considered to be obsolete (in which case you can still use the template, but a warning will be displayed). The uploaded file must be in DOCX format.</p>
	<h4 id="customer-excel-templates">Custom Excel templates</h4>
	<p> Staring release 2.16 onwards the tool also supports the excel templates which can be used to 
		generate the following excel output files or reports by default.
		Like the word templates these templates can similarly be updated or revised.
		<ul>
			<li>For exporting <strong>Risk Register</strong> Risks register report template is used</li>
			<li>For exporting <strong>Brainstorming</strong> Brainstorming Excel template is used</li>
			<li>For exporting <strong>SOA</strong> State Of Applicability report template is used</li>
			<li>For exporting <strong>any other excel file</strong>: Default Excel template is used</li>
		</ul>	
	</p>
	<h5 id="macro-enabled-template">Adding macro enabled template</h5>
	<p>In order that the macros work well with the exported excel files for a specific customer it is required to add a Macro enabled excel Template (with extension: xlsm).
	   Once an excel file for example risk estimation is exported from Trick the macros must be unblocked after the exported file is saved so that the Macros work well.
	   After exporting file once this template is used right click on the exported file and go to Properties and click on unblock checkbox to unblock the macros.

	</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info">This will not only delete the security measure in the knowledge base, but also in all risk analysis that use this measure.</div>
	<h4>Export</h4>
	<p>The “Export” button enables you to export a measures collection from the knowledge base of OpenTRICK. The export is
		an Excel file including all security measures. You have the possibility to make changes in this excel file and use the
		“Import” function to reimport the measures collection with the modifications made (see section “Import ”).</p>
	<h4>Edit</h4>
	<p>The “Edit” button can be used to update the general information concerning the measures collection (name, version, description, type, internal name, computable<!--added-->).</p>
	<h4>Get import template</h4>
	<p>With the “Get import template”, you can retrieve the template needed to import a new measures collection and its security
		measures (see section “Import ”). The template indicates on how the data must be structured in order to be imported into
		OpenTRICK.</p>
	<h4>Import</h4>
	<p>The import measures collection function allows you to import a new standard or collection of best practice that is still
		not included in the knowledge base of OpenTRICK.</p>
	<p>To do so, you must click on the “Import” button. A new window pops up which allows you to select and
		upload a file that includes the measures collection to import. The import file and included information must match an exact

	<ul>
		<li>A unique ID for the impact in the “Name” field;</li>
		<li>An acronym in the “Acronym” field that is used to derive the acronyms for the different scale values by appending the scale
			level (e.g. for the acronym “il”, the parameters for the impact scale in a risk analysis will have the acronyms “il0”,
			“il1”, “il2”, etc.);</li>
		<li>An English, French and Deutsch translation (and abbreviation) that will be used throughout the user interface and in the reports.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="analysis-profiles"><a id="knowledgebase-analyses"></a>Analysis profiles</h3>
	<p>This view shows a list of analysis profiles, which act as templates for risk analysis. During the creation of a new risk
		analysis a risk analysis profile can be selected as basis. This allows creating risk analysis from templates that already
		include some parameters and characteristics which then do not have to be recreated from scratch.</p>
	<p>Three profiles (one for quantitative risk analyses, one for qualitative risk analyses and one for mixed risk analyses) are set as default. These profiles
		will be used for the creation of a new risk analyses if no other profiles are selected.</p>
	<p>You have the possibility</p>

		<li>Create an analysis based on existing analysis.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 id="create-analysis-from-scratch">Create a new analysis from scratch</h4>
	<p>The information required to create the analysis is the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Type: Choose if the risk analysis should be made quantitatively, qualitatively, or a mix of both;</li>
		<li>Company: Select for which company the risk analysis is being conducted for (linked to the list of companies stored in the
			Knowledge Base);</li>
		<li>Language: Select the language of the risk analysis (linked to the list of languages stored in the Knowledge Base);</li>
		<li>Profile (optional): Select an analysis profile template on which the new analysis should be based on (see <a href="#impacts">[Section]</a>) (linked to the list of analysis profiles stored in the Knowledge Base);</li>
		<li>Author: The author parameter is automatically generated depending on who is logged in to OpenTRICK when the new analysis
			was created;</li>
		<li>Title: Indicate a name for the new risk analysis;</li>
		<li>Version: For a new analysis, the version is automatically generated as
			<code>0.0.1</code>. This parameter may be edited for exceptional circumstances;
		</li>
		<li>Description: Enter a short description of the risk analysis including any information which may be useful;</li>
		<li>Uncertainty: Checkbox to indicate if you want to take account of the uncertainty of assessments (only for quantative or mixed analysis). Several features, specific
			to uncertainty will be added to the risk analysis if the checkbox is ticked.</li>
		<li>Impacts: Select the impact scales that you wish to import into the risk analysis (only for qualitative and mixed analysis). The default is to use the same impact
			scales as in the profile (“From profile”).</li>
		<li>Level: Specify the number of levels that shall be used for the impact and probability scales in the analysis (only for qualitative and mixed analysis)</mark>. This option
			cannot be changed if “From profile” is selected in the list above, since in that case the level from the profile is considered.</li>
		<li>Max impact: Specify the maximum value for the quantitative impact scale (only for mixed analysis). This option cannot be changed if “From profile”
			is selected in the list above, since in that case the maximum from the profile is considered. Note that the value provided
			here is only used to initialise the scale with default values; you can fully change the scale afterwards.</li>
			Once all the parameters have been filled in, click the “Save” button to generate the new risk analysis.

	<h3 id="update-profile">Updating analysis profile</h3>
	<p>
		There are two ways to update an analysis profile:
		<ul>
			<li>Updating an analysis created from analysis profile</li>
			<li>Exported as an SQLite file from the knowledge base</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Updating an analysis created from analysis profile</h4>
		<p> <strong>Create:</strong> A new analysis can directly be created from a risk profile by clicking “New analysis” in the analyses overview, 
			and by choosing the desired profile from the select box in the dialog. See Figure <a href="#_FIG_32_0">[Figure]</a><br>

			<strong>Modify:</strong> Once the profile is available as a risk analysis, it can be modified like any normal risk analysis. 
			Set-up scenarios, adjust risk reduction factors (RRF), import measures.<br>
			
			<strong>Re-import as profile:</strong> When all modifications have been made, the risk analysis needs to be converted back to a profile. 
			In the analyses overview, select the analysis that shall be converted, and select “New profile” from the menu – 
			see Figure <a href="#_FIG_32_00">[Figure]</a>.
			A dialog opens for setting up the profile. Type a name under which the profile shall be known as.
			It is highly recommended to add a version number to the name, so as to distinguish it from older versions later on.
			Indeed, neither the history nor the version of the underlying analysis will be copied over to the profile!
			Tip: If for some reason you do not want or have version numbers in the name, first rename the old profile (e.g. name it “ … (old)”), and then create the new profile. The reason for that is because OpenTRICK does not allow multiple profiles with the same name.
			Then, select all measure collections that shall be imported by default in all risk analysis based on the profile. 
			Note that it is preferred to include measure collections in the profile, as this will also include all RRF values 
			associated to the measures! RRF values are stored in a risk analysis/profile, not in the knowledge base.<br>

			<strong>Cleanup:</strong> When the profile has been successfully created, make sure to remove any older profiles from the knowledge base.<br><br>
			<strong>Note:</strong> Profiles which have been set up as “default” cannot directly be deleted. First set the newly created profile as “default”, before the old one can be deleted.
			It is recommended, however, to keep the underlying analysis (not profile) in OpenTRICK.

		<h5 id="administration-ts-ticketing_system_management_email"><a id="administration-ts-ticketing_system_management_email"></a>Managing customer ticketing system Email</h5>
		<p>	If email ticketing option is selected then an email template needs to be additionally set for the customer. 
				In order to do this select the customer and Click "Manage email template for ticketing system" <a href="#FIG_TEMP">[Figure]</a>. 
				Edit the template in the dialog box that appears <a href="#_FIG_EMAIL_TEXT_FORMAT">[Figure]</a>
		</p>		
		<ul>The fields of the template are explained below:
			<li><strong>Email:</strong> The email id of the responsible user whom the ticketing system email(s) will be sent</li>
			<li><strong>Subject:</strong> The subject of the email to be sent by the ticketing system. It is limited by 998 characters and must be chosen from one of the following options:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Security measure:</strong>If this subject is chosen then the subject line of email is replaced by the corresponding Security measure for which the ticket was created.</li>
					<li><strong>Collection Security measure:</strong> If this subject is chosen then the subject line of email is replaced by the collection number followed by corresponding Security measure for which the ticket was created.</li>
					<li><strong>To do:</strong> If this subject is chosen then the subject line of email is replaced by the "To do" column of Security measure for which the ticket was created. </li>
					<li><strong>To check:</strong> If this subject is chosen then the subject line of email is replaced by the "To check" column of Security measure for which the ticket was created.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Pause between emails:</strong> This is the interval between sending two consecutive emails. This ensures that the email delivery system does not consider these emails as spam.</li>
			<li><strong>HTML Format:</strong> The body of the text message could be specified in an HTML format or in TEXT format. This option allows the user to choose between the two.</li>
			<li><strong>Body:</strong> The body is a template email message in either a raw text format or html format which can contain the placeholders enumerated below.
				However for a better compatibility with ticketing system prefer to use text format.
				<p>In order to separate the different fields/placeholders and view them in outlook in new lines it is recommended to place " ;   " (space followed by a semi colon followed by 3 spaces) 
					after each line in the body.
				</p> 
				Please note that special characters in the template should not be used for an effective ticketing system management.
				These placeholders stand for respective columns of the Risk Treatment/Compliance Collection (see <a href="#analysis-standards">[Section]</a>).

	<p>The options of the “Various parameters” table are the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Internal setup rate:</strong> Average cost of one internal man-day. Used to compute implementation costs of security measures.</li>
		<li><strong>External setup rate:</strong> Average cost of one external man-day. Used to compute the implementation costs of security measures.</li>
		<li><strong>Default lifetime:</strong> Default lifetime of a security measure before it must be re-implemented. When ever you do not enter a
			value for the lifetime of a security measure, OpenTRICK will consider the default lifetime specified here, instead.</li>
		<li><strong>Max RRF (only for quantitative analyses):</strong> Used to fine-tune the Risk Reduction Factor (RRF). The Max RRF value is expressed
			in percentage. The RRF will be multiplied with the MAX RRF value to fine-tune the RRF.</li>
		<li><strong>SOA:</strong> Used to only consider measure with implementation rate &lt; SOA for the SOA section. If an ISO 27002 security measure
			has an implementation rate that is higher than the SOA threshold parameter, the security measure is sufficiently implemented
			to fulfil the ISO/IEC 27001 minimum requirements.</li>
		<li><strong>Mandatory phase:</strong> Option to define a phase in which all security measures become mandatory to be implemented.</li>
		<li><strong>RRF threshold:</strong> The RRF threshold determines which security measures need to be implemented in the qualitative action plan for a given risk scenario.
			The measures are determined based on three conditions. 
			<ul>
			   <li>The implementation rate of the measure is not 100 %</li>
			   <li>The measure is applicable</li>
			   <li>RRF will be computed using measure and risk estimation (Asset and Scenario combination).

	<h3 id="dynamic-probability-parameters">Dynamic probability parameters</h3>
	<p>In order to do a quantitative evaluation modelling dynamic parameters can be added to the risk analysis. 
		<ul>The following steps can be used to achieve this:
			<li><strong>Add Probe to access OpenTRICK API.</strong> Refer <a href="#ids">[SECTION]</a></li>
			<li><strong>Enable probe subscription for the risk analysis. </strong>Refer <a href="#manage-ids">[SECTION]</a>. Note that multiple 
			analysis can share the same probe and thus there are certain limitations with the use of these probes.</li>
			<li><strong>Setup dynamic parameters for risk analysis. </strong>Use the script <a href="./js/SRC_Rxxx_TS-NotifyToTS_v0.0.2.txt" target="_blank"> Push-To-TS </a> in a power shell client to set dynamic parameters.
				Refer <a href="#_set_dynamic_params" target="_blank"> [FIGURE] </a> for setting dynamic parameters defined in a CSV file Example: <a href="./js/data.csv">data.csv</a>. 
				All the analysis where the probe subscription is enabled will have the dynamic parameters set after running this script on command line. The script if run successfully will return
				a status of 200. Once set these parameters are visible in "Risk context" as "Dynamic probability parameters" Refer <a href="#_view_dynamic_parameters" target="_blank"> [FIGURE] </a>. <br><br>
				<em>Please note that dynamic parameters are prefixed with the name of the probe, where any special characters in the probe name are replaced by underscores ("_"). Additionally, any special characters in the parameter name are also replaced by underscores to prevent issues with mathematical operators (e.g., "-") that could interfere with expression evaluation.
				</em>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Setup impacts based on dynamic parameters. </strong>Once the dynamic parameters are set these parameters can be used as arithmetic expressions to define impacts for the given risk analysis
				Refer <a href="#_set_impacts_based_on_dynamic_params" target="_blank"> [FIGURE] </a>.</li>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Exclusion:</strong>Dynamic parameters once added to risk analysis can be excluded from the analysis by pressing the trash button next to the parameter.
			These excluded parameters are moved to "Excluded dynamic parameters" section.
			If a parameter is in use (example an expression in the risk analysis) it cannot be excluded.
			A permanent exclusion of paramater can only happen if the risk analysis unsubscribes from the probe and doesnt subscribe again.
		<li><strong>Reinclusion:</strong>Dynamic parameters once excluded can be reincluded by pressing the redo button.</li>
		<li><strong>Properties of Exclusion & Reinclusion:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>If an excluded parameter is added again by running the Push-To-TS script (whether with the same or modified value):
					<ul>
						<li>It will not be automatically moved to the dynamic parameter list. Instead, it will remain in the excluded parameter list until it is manually restored.</li>
						<li>The value of parameter will be updated however.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If the analysis is unsubscribed from the probe, the excluded parameters will no longer be available/visible in the analysis.
					Re-subscribing to the probe will show up the excluded list corresponding to the given probe.

	<h5>Adding an asset</h5>
	<p>If there are no assets in the table already, the only option available to the user will be “Add”. To add an asset to the
		list, click on the “Add” button which will open the box seen in the figure below.</p>
	<figure id="_FIG_55" class="figure">
		<img src="img/58.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Add new asset.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>The following information related to each asset should be indicated when adding an asset:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Name: the name of the asset;</li>
		<li>Type: select from a drop-down list one of the following asset types:
			<ul>
				<li>Business process;</li>
				<li>Compliance;</li>
				<li>Financial;</li>
				<li>Hardware;</li>

	<h5>Editing an asset</h5>
	<p>Editing an asset can be done in two different ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Double-click on the asset in the table to open the box indicated in <a href="#_FIG_55">[Figure]</a>. The box will contain all the information that was previously entered and can be directly edited before re-saving

			will now be highlighted in blue, allowing to click on it to open the information box.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Select and unselect</h5>
	<p>The “Select” and “Unselect” buttons are used to select which assets are to be included in the computation. Ticking the box
		next to an asset and then clicking the relevant “Select” or “Unselect” button will either include or exclude the asset
		from the risk analysis (it will not be displayed during risk estimation). If an asset in the list has a green background,
		it is included. If it has a white background, it is excluded from the computation. An orange background indicates that
		no asset value has been indicated (which is optional and not needed for risk computation).</p>
	<h5>Deleting an asset</h5>
	<p>To delete an asset, select the asset by ticking the box next to it on the left-hand side. Once the box is ticked, click
		the “delete” button in the ribbon to delete the asset from the list. All the assets in the list can be deleted together
		by ticking the box at the top of the far-left column to select all assets and then clicking “Delete”.</p>

	<h3 id="risk-register"><a id="analysis-risk-register"></a>Risk register</h3>
	<p>The risk register is specific to risk assessments which are conducted in the context of the CSSF risk analysis. Its purpose
		is to provide an overview of the most important risks (based on their potential impact) sorted by category.</p>
	<p>The OpenTRICK risk register can be used to provide the following information to the CSSF:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The 20 most important direct risks (based on their potential impact);</li>
		<li>The most important indirect risks (based on their potential impact);</li>
		<li>Other risks which have a net impact of ≥ 6 and a net probability ≥ 5.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="charts">Charts</h3>
	<h4><a id="analysis-chart-compliance"></a>Compliance by measures collection</h4>
	<p>The section “Compliance” graphically represents the level of conformance with the standards ISO 27001 &amp;
		27002 after the different implementation phases that have been defined.</p>
	<p>A chapter with all not-applicable measures will appear on the chart without conformance value, mentioned with (NA).</p>
	<h4><a id="analysis-chart-heat-map"></a>Risk heat map (only for qualititative and mixed risk analysis)</h4>
	<p>The risk heat map provides an overview of the number of risks per risk level. This allows, based on the risk acceptance
		thresholds, to see the number of risks that are currently not acceptable.</p>
	<p><a href="#_FIG_heatmap">[Figure]</a> shows an example heat map. On the right hand-side, the risk acceptance thresholds
		are repeated for convenience (see <a href="#risk-acceptance-threshold">[Section]</a>). The left hand-side shows the
		heatmap table, each cell of which containing the number of risks that were specified for the given impact and probability level.</p>

	<p>Below, the same heat map is displayed again, but this taking the evolution of risk into account. See <a href="#_FIG_heatmap-evolution">[Figure]</a>
		for an example. Each dot in the heatmap represents a risk with its net risk (the values specified in the “NET” row in <a href="#risk-sheet">[Section]</a>).
		Arrows point to the new impact/probability levels (the values specified in the “EXP” row in <a href="#risk-sheet">[Section]</a>).
		On the right hand-side, each risk can be individually shown/hidden by clicking on the respective name. For convenience,
		in the top right corner, you can also specify the number of risks you want to display (the top N are displayed in that case).</p>

	<h3 id="manual-update">Manual update</h3>
	<h4>Compute risk profile measures</h4>
	<p> The Risk Profile measures are computed based on following three preconditions:
		<ul>
			<li>The measure should not have 100 % implementation rate.</li>
			<li>The measure should be applicable</li>
			<li>The RRF (see <a href="#various-parameters">[Section]</a>) is computed based on risk estimation and the applicable measures are those
				for which RRF >= RRF threshold .
			</li>
		</ul>
		The applicable measures for risk scenarios can be viewed in in the Risk Sheet in Collection, Ref., Security measure section. 
		Refer (<a href="#risk-sheet">[Section]</a>). As an example the Risk Sheet will be populated with Security measures like in the figure given below:
	</p>

	</figure>
	<p>Once the action plan is computed further. The qualitative action plan gets generated 
		which contains consolidated measures of all the risk scenarios. The column <strong>NR</strong> displays the number of 
		risks for a particular measure and <strong>I.</strong> denotes the importance associated with the measure.	
		Refer figure below for a generated sample Qualitative action plan

		(see <a href="#analysis-action-plan">[Section]</a>).</p>
	<h4>Reload charts</h4>
	<p>Refreshes all charts in the risk analysis. This option should only be used in case there is a failure in the automatic update
		of the charts.</p>
	<h4>Refresh estimations</h4>
	<p>The update estimation option will recompute all ALE. This option should only be used when the automatic computation of the
		ALE failed.</p>

The left-hand side of the interface will then show configuration options (if applicable), which are explained in the sub-sections below. As a final step, the data can be exported via the “Export” button in the lower right corner. See <a href="#_FIG_exportui">[Figure]</a> for an illustration.</p>
	<h4>Assets</h4>
	<p>You can export all assets used in the risk analysis as an Excel file by click on "Assets" and then "Export" button.</p>
	<h4>Brainstorming</h4>
	<p>Export all data from all sheets from the “Brainstorming” section (see <a href="#brainstorming">[Section]</a>) into a single Excel file (with three sheets). The structure of the Excel file is the same as the one in OpenTRICK.</p>

	<h4 id="export--json_interface">ILR: JSON File for Serima</h4>
	<p>This option allows users to export a risk assessment file in an ILR compatible JSON format. This generated JSON file can be further imported to Serima platform thereby 
		ensuring cross tool compatibility.</p>
	<p>There are two mandatory inputs required to be provided during the import. Refer (<a href="#_FIG_exportjson">[Figure]</a>) below.
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>JSON source file (Exported from Serima):</strong> The user requires to provide a path to the JSON file exported from Serima.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Mapping file: </strong>The user should provide here a path of (; separated) CSV file which maps OpenTRICK names to ILR names. It is important to note here that the mapping From
				TrickService AssetName to corresponding Serima Asset name (defined by ILR) is a many to many mapping. The user can provide the name of an asset to be mapped to serima and can also provide a name of
				a standard to be mapped in serima. Standard names may imply name of collection of measures used in OpenTRICK with corresponding name of Referentials or Recommendation Sets used in serima platform.

		<p>In order to export the JSON file containing the risk management plan with appropriate information of the recommendations, security measures, statement of applicability
			 the following process must be carried out before exporting the JSON file from OpenTRICK:
			<ul>
				<li> <strong>Enable ILR analysis:</strong> Enable ILR analysis from advanced settings</a>)

					</figure>				
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Manage Statement of applicability:</strong> Apply the statement of applicability for various security standards Refer ( <a href="#manage-soa-settings">[Section]</a>)</li>
				<li> <strong>Fine tune the RRF threshold: </strong>The RRF threshold determines which security measures need to be implemented in the action plan for a given risk scenario.
					This threshold needs to be fine tuned before exporing risk analysis. Refer ( <a href="#various-parameters">[Section]</a>) </li>
				<li> <strong>Manage SOA scale Mapping parameters:</strong> Fine tune the SOA scale mapping parameters from the Parameters settings. 
					The SOA scale Mapping parameters classify the level of compliance of a security measure based on the implementation rate of a security measure.
					 Refer ( <a href="#ilr-soa-scale-mapping">[Section]</a>) 
					Alternately refer example of SOA scale shown below.

				<li><strong>Edit Importance and Todo in Measures collection:</strong> Verify that the recommendations as defined by 'To do' column and their Importance as defined by 'I' column
					 of the security measures for the applicable collections (for the applicable measures not having 100 % implementation rate) are uptodate. Refer (<a href="#analysis-standards">[Section]</a>)</li>
				<li><strong>Compute risk profile measures:</strong> After completing the above steps generate the risk profile measures Refer (<a href="#manual-update">[Section]</a>). The associated measures

	<h4 id="export--risk-estimations">Risk estimations</h4>
	<p>By clicking on “Export”, you will get an Excel spreadsheet that contains all likelihood and impact estimations for all assets and scenarios.</p>
	<ul>The Risk Estimation exported file contains the following Sheets in addition to all sheets present in the Template excel file:
		<li><strong>Assets</strong> This sheet lists all the assets in "Assets" table with corresponding information available in Risk analysis.</li>
		<li><strong>Risk estimation</strong> This sheet captures all the risk estimation information for all assets with corresponding scenarios in "Risk_estimation" table.</li>
		<li><strong>AssetTypes</strong> This sheet captures all the supported asset types in "AssetTypes" table.</li>
		<li><strong>Scenarios</strong> This sheet captures all the available scenario in "Scenarios" table.</li>
		<li><strong>ScenarioTypes</strong> This sheet captures all the available scenario types in "ScenarioTypes" table.</li>
		<li><strong>Dependency</strong> This sheet captures the asset dependency matrix. This sheet is exported only if ILR analysis is enabled. Refer <a href="#asset-dependency">[SECTION]</a></li>
		<li><strong>Probability</strong> This sheet captures the Probability scale of the risk analysis. This sheet is exported only if ILR analysis is enabled.</li>
	</ul>

	<h5 id="asset-dependency">Asset dependency</h5>
	<p>Asset dependency matrix is a square matrix of size n x m where n is the number of assets where m <= n.
		The matrix value 1 indicates that the asset in the row is dependent on the asset specified in the column.
		A positive value in matrix between 0 to 1 indicates the probability of dependency between the assets.
		The matrix is asymmetric. The matrix is exported in the Dependency sheet of the exported file. The matrix is exported only if ILR analysis is enabled.
		This dependency matrix can also be imported using DRAW tool and then synchronized with OpenTRICK. For details refer <a href="https://draw.trickservice.com/documentation/index.html">Draw documentation</a>.

		<ol>The C(confidentiality),I (Integrity),A(Availability) values of an asset are computed using Dependency Graph of the asset if the asset CIA values are not explicitly specified. 
			The rules for computation of inherited CIA values of an asset is as below:
			<li>If asset has CIA value explicitly specified then the same is considered as CIA value of the asset.</li>
			<li>If the asset doesn't have CIA value explicitly specified then the value of CIA is inherited from that of parent provided the parent is selected.</li>
			<li>If the asset doesn't have CIA value explicitly specified then the value of CIA is inherited from the grand parent if the parent is not selected.</li>
			<li>If Asset and its parent do not have explicit CIA value specified the value of asset node is inherited from the grand parent if there is a single parent.</li>
			<li>In case of multiple parents the asset node has CIA which is the maximum of the selected parent(s).<br>
			    NOTE: This propogation of CIA value from multiple parents to child is not aligned with Monarc where Monarc creates multiple child nodes having different CIA values under the different parent nodes.
				Open OpenTRICK on the other hand has a single asset instance which accounts for the difference.
			Refer example <a href="#_fig_asset_CIA_values">[Figure]</a> for a basic example.
			</li>

	<p>In contrast to the risk sheet, this spreadsheet can be imported back into OpenTRICK.</p> 
	
	<h5 id="export-risk-estimation-with-additional-columns">Export risk estimation with-additional columns</h5>
	<p> Given that ILR analysis is enabled the tool allows the user to add additional columns to the risk estimation
		exported file. The input can be provided using a dedicated CSV file in the file selection input box as below:
		<figure class="figure" id="export-risk-estimations-csv-input">
			<img src="img/export-risk-estimations-csv-input.png" alt="Export as JSON" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
			<figcaption class="figure-caption">Export interface</figcaption>
		</figure>

		The input file if provided in the above dialog box should be a CSV file specifying the formulas 
		relative to Risk estimation sheets.

		<br>Example of one such input CSV file could be:<br>
		<code>
			Relative Name; VLOOKUP(Risk_estimation[@[Asset]];Assets[#All];7;0) <br>
			Label Th.;Risk_estimation[@Scenario] <br>
			Pr;VLOOKUP(Risk_estimation[@[RAW Probability]];Probabilty[#All];3;0) <br>
		</code>
		
		The above file if provided will additionally add three columns 'Relative Name', 'Label Th.'' and 'Pr' in the exported risk estimation using 
		the values in Tables 'Assets' and 'Probabilty' in the Risk Estimation file. <br>		
		NOTE: This feature is only available when the Enable ILR analysis is Set in Manage analysis settings.

	<h4 id="export--rrf">Risk reduction factors</h4>
	<p>This option allows to export all RRF values of the different standards in Microsoft Excel format. This allows the user to modify more fast several RRF values. With the help of the Import option, the user can reimport and overwrite the RRF values again.</p>
	<div class="alert alert-warning">
		The exported file is bound to the analysis and analysis version that it was exported from!

	<p>The risk sheet can exported in two formats: as a Word report (for printing) or as an Excel file (for manipulation). The following options can be configured:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Risk sheets format:</strong> (Only for Word report) Whether the risk sheet should meet with the CSSF requirements.</li>
		<li><strong>Impact/Probability threshold:</strong> These options remove risk analysis that have the Impact/Probability less than these values from the exported report. <!-- The minimum impact/probability starting at which a risk is exported.-->In other words, if a risk has a lower impact/probability, it will be omitted in the export.</li>
		<li><strong>Direct size:</strong> The number of most important “direct” (in the CSSF sense) risks that shall be exported. In other words, this value (e.g. 20) allows the user to have a list of the risks (e.g. 20) that have direct effect to the risk analysis. All other risks will be omitted. Select “All” to disable the filter.</li>
		<li><strong>Indirect size:</strong> The number of most important “indirect” (in the CSSF sense) risks that shall be exported. All other risks will be omitted. Select “All” to disable the filter.</li>
		<li><strong>CIA size:</strong> The number of most important "confidentiality/integrity/availablity" risks that shall be exported. All other risks will be omitted. Select “All” to disable the filter.</li>
		<li><strong>Owner:</strong> A filter for only exporting those risks that are associated to the selected owner. Select “All” to disable the filter.</li>

	<p>When exporting a report, you will be asked to select the template to use. The list features all templates deployed by default in OpenTRICK, and the templates that have been manually uploaded for the related customer (see <a href="#customers">[Section]</a>).
		For mixed reports use bookmarks in the word template to set which aspects of the report are to be exported in "qualitative" and which are to be exported in "quantitative".</p>
	<p>You can also upload a previously exported report that gets automatically updated (even if styling or content changes have been made to the document).</p>
	<h5 id="word--report-external-template">Word report using external template</h5>

	<h3 id="import--">Import</h3>
	<p>Clicking on “Import” will open the centralised import interface, from where data can be imported back (again) into OpenTRICK.</p>

		<img src="img/import_end.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Centralized import interface.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>The interface is structured as follows: on the right-hand side, the user can choose what shall be imported. The left-hand side of the interface will then show configuration options (if applicable) and a possibility to select the import file. The options are explained in the sub-sections below. As a final step, the data can be imported via the “Import” button in the lower right corner. See <a href="#_FIG_importui">[Figure]</a> for an illustration.</p>
	<h4 id="import--assets">Assets</h4>
	<p>The user can import assets that have been exported previously using OpenTRICK.</p>
	<h4 id="import--brainstorming">Brainstorming</h4>
	<p>Importing brainsorming can be done using two modes:</p>
	<li><strong>Overwrite:</strong>Clears all data from the sheets in OpenTRICK, and replaces it with the data contained in the provided Excel file (with three sheets). It is strongly recommended to use a previously exported file as a template.</li>
	<li><strong>Update:</strong>Update: If this mode is selected the import of a brainstorming excel sheet will not erase the existing values before the import.
		        When this option is selected the values that have the same ID are overwritten.</li>

	<p>Imports back previously exported risk estimations from an Excel spreadsheet. The format of the file is the same than the one exported by OpenTRICK (<a href="#export--risk-estimations">[Section]</a>). Instead of starting from a raw file, consider exporting a file, adapting it, and importing it.</p>
	<h4 id="import--RRF">Risk reduction factors</h4>
	<p>The RRF values can be imported either from a previously exported file, or from the knowledge database (i.e., from another analysis). In either case, the RRF values will be replaced by those in the file/analysis for the selected standards.</p>
	<p>In the first case, the file must match the format of the file exported by OpenTRICK (<a href="#export--rrf">[Section]</a>). The RRF values for all standards contained in the file will be imported. When a standard is missing in the file, the related RRF values will remain unchanged in the analysis.</p>
	<p>In the second case, the user must select a risk analysis profile, or an analysis of a customer. In a seconds step, the user must select all standards for which he wishes to import the RRF values; multiple standards can be selected using the SHIFT or CTRL keys on the keyboard. When a standard is not selected, the related RRF values will remain unchanged in the analysis.</p>

	<h1 id="annex-b-api">Annex B – API</h1>
	<p>OpenTRICK includes an HTTP/ReST API for providing external risk input to risk analyses, making them thus dynamic. External
		input is available as named parameters in a risk assessment, more precisely, in the “probability” field of every risk assessment.</p>
	<h2 id="use">Use</h2>
	<p>Before the API can be accessed, a dedicated “probe” needs to be created and enabled via the Administration interface
		(see <a href="#ids">[Section]</a> for details). By default, the newly created probe does not have access to any risk analysis. In the risk
		analysis overview, click on “Manage probe subscriptions” (see <a href="#manage-ids">[Section]</a>) and select the probe you wish to subscribe to. Every risk analysis that is subscribed to a probe,
		gets automatically updated when the probe reports to the OpenTRICK API. Put differently, when a probe updates dynamic
		parameters via the API, all risk analyses that have subscribed to this probe will update their corresponding copies of the
		dynamic parameters to the given values. If you wish that dynamic parameters should no longer be updated for a certain risk
		analysis, unsubscribe from the respective probe via the “Manage probe subscriptions” interface (see <a href="#manage-ids">[Section]</a>).</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info">For performance reasons, the dynamic parameters are only updated once every 900 seconds (15 minutes). More precisely, if
		a value is reported via the API, it is first checked if an update of the dynamic parameters is already scheduled. If yes,
		nothing happens (the value will be handled in the scheduled update), otherwise an update is scheduled after 900 seconds.
		In particular, the dynamic parameters will only be updated 900 seconds after the first API call.</div>
	<h2 id="http-requests">HTTP requests</h2>
	<p>API calls are made using secured HTTPS requests to OpenTRICK. If OpenTRICK is running on e.g.
		<code>https://trickservice.itrust.lu</code>, then the API calls should be made (usually via POST) to
		<code>https://trickservice.itrust.lu/Api/&lt;method_name&gt;</code>, where the available method names are listed below.Every HTTP request must have the following HTTP headers set:</p>
	<pre>Accept: application/json;charset=UTF-8 <br />Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8 <br />X-Auth-Token: &lt;api_token&gt;</pre>
	<p>Above,
		<code>&lt;api_token&gt;</code> should be replaced by the API token that is displayed in the probe administration ( <a href="#ids">[Section]</a>). It is this token that is responsible for the authentication.The actual HTTP request body must be encoded
		in JSON. See the sections below for more details.</p>
	<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
	<p>The OpenTRICK exposes methods which can be accessed using a HTTP client as described below. Parameters are passed to
		the API in the HTTP request body in JSON format (using the “application/json;charset=utf-8” encoding).The supported methods
		are explained in the following subsections.</p>
	<h3 id="setting-dynamic-parameters">Setting dynamic parameters</h3>
	<p>This method defines a new dynamic parameter that can be used in risk assessments.This method is called with HTTP “POST”
		and is available at
		<code>/Api/ids/set</code>.The expected parameters are of the form</p>
	<pre>{ &quot;data&quot;: [ <br /> { &quot;c&quot;: &lt;category&gt;, &quot;t&quot;: &lt;time&gt;, &quot;v&quot;: &lt;value&gt; }, <br /> ... <br />] }</pre>
	<p>for arbitrarily many elements. The placeholders are to be replaced according to the table below.</p>
	<table class="table table-sm table-striped">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Placeholder</th>
				<th>JSON data type</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>&lt;category&gt;</td>
				<td>String</td>
				<td>The name of the dynamic parameter to create/update.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>&lt;time&gt;</td>
				<td>Integer</td>
				<td>The timestamp when the parameter shall obtain the value. In most cases this value is
					<code>now()</code>. The timestamp is expressed as the number of seconds since 1 January 1970, 00:00:00 UTC (often called “UNIX timestamp”).
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>&lt;value&gt;</td>
				<td>Floating point</td>
				<td>The ‘value’ of the parameter as a floating point number at the specified &lt;timestamp&gt;.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Each line defines a parameter which has the given value starting from the given time and until the next timestamp for which
		a value was defined. For instance, if the API receives two requests that define (c=demo, t=0, v=5) and (c=demo, t=3600,
		v=10), then the parameter “demo” has the value 5 between 12:00am and 1:00am, and the value 10 starting from 1:00am.</p>
	<h3 id="reporting-ids-notifications">Reporting probe notifications</h3>
	<p>This method accepts notifications (alerts) from external sources (such as intrusion detection systems) from which TRICK
		Service computes a risk level (from 0 to 1) that is available as a dynamic parameter in risk assessments. Each alert will
		raise the risk level: the higher the severity (see below), the higher the risk level will be raised. The risk level will
		slowly decrease with time (in an exponential fashion) again: the half-life (see below) of the alert affects how fast it
		will decrease.This method is called with HTTP “POST” and is available at
		<code>/Api/ids/notify</code>. The expected parameters are of the form</p>
	<pre>{ &quot;data&quot;: [ <br /> { &quot;c&quot;: &lt;category&gt;, &quot;t&quot;: &lt;time&gt;, &quot;h&quot;: &lt;halflife&gt;, &quot;s&quot;: &lt;severity&gt;, &quot;n&quot;: &lt;number&gt; }, <br /> ... <br />] }</pre>

	<h3>Create a new Risk Analysis from default profile</h3>
	<p>Prerequisite for creating a new risk analsis is existence of customer/company for which the Risk analysis is to be created.</p>
	<h4>Create a new customer</h3>
	<p>Select the menu "Knowledge base" and within it the Tab "Customers". Add a new customer as shown in screen below. 
	   Once the customer is added the same must be displayed in customer list.

		<figcaption class="figure-caption">Customer list.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h4>Create analysis</h4>
	<p>Refer  <a href="#creating-a-new-analysis">Create a new risk analysis</a> for creating a new risk analysis.
	<ul>
	Note that the default profiles available for creating a new risk analysis are:
		<li>Quantitatve default profile</li>
		<li>Qualitative default profile</li>
	</ul>	
    </p>

	<h2 id="how-to-create-RA-from-existing-RA">How to create a Risk Analysis from an existing Risk analysis</h2>
	<p> Once a risk analysis is created, a new risk analysis can be created from it by using the same Risk Analyis or parts of it.
		Refer <a href="#section-1-5-1-2">Create a risk analysis by taking parts of it</a>.
	</p>

	<h2 id="how-to-share-analysis">How to share analysis with another user</h2>
	<p>Often, an analysis needs to be shared with multiple people who have different access rights. If someone cannot view the analysis, 
		it is likely because they do not have the necessary access permissions.
		Refer <a href="#manage-access-rights">Manage access rights</a> and  <a href="#section-1-5-2-1">Inviting new users</a>
	</p>

	<h2 id="how-to-upgrade-measure-collection">How to upgrade the measure collection to a new version of standard</h2>

	<h3>Preliminary Steps</h3>
	<h4 id="import-security-standard">Import security standard</h4>
	<p>In order to import a security standard into OpenTRICK, a file with a special format has to be 
		provided. A template for such a file can be obtained directly in OpenTRICK, see <a href="#get-template-for-importing-new-std">[Figure]</a> 
		Alternatively, another standard can also be exported, and the obtained file manipulated accordingly.
		<div class="alert alert-warning">Either way, make sure that the [Name] and [Version] columns in the “NormInfo” sheet are 
			changed appropriately! Otherwise, data from another security standard will be overwritten 
			(if it has the same name/version) – which will also reflect on all analyses that use this standard!
		</div>
		
		It is recommended to always have back-ups (obtained via export) of all standards in the knowledge base.

	<h4 id="backup">Back-up</h4>
	<p>As for any task that involves the manipulation of a lot of data, it is highly recommended to 
		create a new version of the analysis that shall be migrated. It will serve as a back-up in case 
		something goes wrong.

	<h3>Upgrade risk analysis to use new standard </h3>
	<p>The migration consists of the following steps</p>
	<ul>
		<li> exporting the data for the old standard <a href="#exporting-the-data-for-the-old-standard">[Section]</a></li>
		<li> upgrading to the new standard in the risk analysis (structure only) <a href="#upgrading-to-the-new-standard-in-the-risk-analysis">[Section]</a></li>
		<li> exporting a template for the new standard (structure only) <a href="#exporting-template-for-the-new-standard">[Section]</a></li>
		<li> copying the values from the first export file to the second one in Excel <a href="#copying-the-values-from-the-first-export-file-to-the-second-one-in-Excel">[Section]</a></li>
		<li> importing the second file back into the analysis <a href="#importing-the-second-file-back-into-the-analysis">[Section]</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>	Note that due to technical limitations, it is not possible at the moment to reference multiple 
		versions of the same standard in the same risk analysis. Therefore, when adding a new version 
		of a standard to the risk analysis, the old version must be removed first.
	</p>

	<h4 id="exporting-the-data-for-the-old-standard">Exporting the data for the old standard</h4>
	<p>
		To export the estimations for a security standard, open the Advanced Menu (see <a href="#export-menu">Export menu</a>) and click “Export”. 
		In the export interface, choose “Security Measures” and select the old standard, then export.
		The exported Excel file contains all cost and workload estimations that have been entered into 
		OpenTRICK.
	</p>
	<figure id="export-menu" class="figure">
		<img src="img/export-menu.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />

	</figure>

	<h4 id="upgrading-to-the-new-standard-in-the-risk-analysis">Upgrading to the new standard in the risk analysis (structure only)</h4>
	<p>
		If the new version of the standard has been imported into the knowledge base, 
		then it can be added to the risk analysis.
		Inside a risk analysis, click “Manage collections”, see Figure below.
		<figure id="manage-collections" class="figure">
			<img src="img/manage-collections.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" />
			<figcaption class="figure-caption">Get list of references in use by the analysis.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		A pop-up will appear which shows all currently referenced security standards.
		First, the old standard needs to be removed from the risk analysis. 
		Note that this will also wipe all data (cost estimations etc) that is associated to it 
		– which should have been exported by this point (<a href="#exporting-the-data-for-the-old-standard">[Section]</a>). 
		This action will not affect the knowledge base!
		Select the old standard from the list, click the “Delete” button, and confirm – see Figure below.

	</p>
	
	<h4 id="exporting-template-for-the-new-standard">Exporting a template for the new standard (structure only)</h4>
	<p>
		The migration will be done manually in Excel by copying values from an export file to an import file.
		The import file (or a template thereof) can be obtained by repeating the steps in (<a href="#exporting-the-data-for-the-old-standard">[Section]</a>),
		but this time for the new standard.
	</p>
	<h4 id="copying-the-values-from-the-first-export-file-to-the-second-one-in-Excel">Copying the values from the first export file to the second one in Excel</h4>
	<p>
		When all steps have been carried out, the data can be migrated. At this point ensure the following:
		<ul>
			<li> The risk analysis should reference the new standard, but not the old one</li>
			<li> Ensure to have an export file that contains all estimations for the old standard</li>		
			<li> Ensure to have an export file for the new standard, which only contains empty and default values.</li>
		</ul>
		
		Open the two exported files – one for the old standard, and one for the new standard – 
		in two Excel windows side by side. 
		In the following, the file representing the old standard is referred to as [OLD],
		and the file representing the new standard is referred to as [NEW]. 
		Then migrate the data as follows:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Add a new column to the left of column A in [OLD].</li>
			<li>Copy the column A from [NEW] to the newly added column in [OLD].</li>
			<li>In [NEW], go through each line. Three cases can occur:
			  <ol>
				<li>The cells in columns A and B match: in that case, do nothing</li>
				<li>The content of the cell in A does not occur in the entire column B: in that case,
					 move down all rows of columns BCDEF… by one row, starting from the current row (see <a href="#move-match-a">[Figure]</a>).
				</li>

				</figure>
				<li>The content of the cell in B does not occur in the entire column A: in that case,
					 move down all rows of column A by one row,
					 starting from the current row (see <a href="#move-match-b">[Figure]</a>).

					<figcaption class="figure-caption">Move down column A by one,

				</figure>

			  </ol>			  
			</li>
			<li>Go through all rows R<sub>A</sub> that have an empty cell in column A; those represent the IDs present in the old standard, but no longer in the new one.</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Check if the security measure has obtained a different ID in the new standard, in which case there is a corresponding empty cell in some row R<sub>B</sub> in column B.</li>
				<li>If yes, move the remaining cells on row R<sub>A</sub> (columns CDEF…) to the corresponding new row R<sub>B</sub>.</li>
				<li>In any case, delete the row R<sub>A</sub>.</li>
			</ol>	
			<li>Go through all rows that have an empty cell in column B; those represent the IDs present in the new standard, but not yet in the old one</li>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Insert default data into the cells in columns CDEF… This default data can for example be copied from [NEW].
				</li>
				<li>
					Copy the content (that is, the ID) from the cell in column A to the cell in column B.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Copy the entire table from [OLD] to [NEW].</li>
			<li>Save [NEW]. The changes in [OLD] can be discarded</li>
		</ol>

	<h2 id="how-to-rename-assets-scenarios">How to rename Asset and Scenario from Excel</h2>
	<p>The best way to handle this is making changes to asset name in the OpenTRICK interface so that the corresponding scenarios 
		are applied to the renamed assets. However there may be situaions when the change is needed to be made in excel instead 
		and further the analysis is imported to OpenTRICK. 
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Export the Risk estimation sheet from TRICK interface:</strong>Refer section <a href="#export--risk-estimations">Export risk estimation</a></li>
			<li><strong>Rename Assets in "Assets" sheet in exported risk estimation file:</strong> In the exported excel file add a column in Asset sheet in excel called OldName. Copy over ALL the old names
			to new name column. This will keep track of the changes done. Later rename the "Name" column refer <a href="#fig-rename-assets">[FIGURE]</a>
			In this example all asset names having a substring "_PRO_" need to be changed to corresponding substring "_PROCESS_".
			</li>
			<li><strong>Rename Assets in "Scenarios" sheet in exported risk estimation file: Similarly rename the "Asset" column after backing up names of assets in "OldAsset" name column.</strong>
			<li><strong>Import Assets in OpenTRICK:</strong>It is essential to first import the Assets ONLY in OpenTRICK before importing the updated Risk estimation. Use the Risk estimation workbook modified in previsiou step to import only assets first in OpenTRICK. Refer <a href="#import--">[SECTION]</a></li>

	<p>A quantitative evaluation model can be added to OpenTRICK by adding dynamic parameters to risk analysis. 
		<ul>The following steps can be used to achieve this:
			<li><strong>Add Probe to access OpenTRICK API.</strong> Refer <a href="#ids">[SECTION]</a></li>
			<li><strong>Enable probe subscription for the risk analysis. </strong>Refer <a href="#manage-ids">[SECTION]</a></li>
			<li><strong>Setup dynamic parameters for risk analysis. </strong>Use the script <a href="./js/SRC_Rxxx_TS-NotifyToTS_v0.0.2.txt" target="_blank"> Push-To-TS </a> in a power shell client to set dynamic parameters.
				Refer <a href="#_set_dynamic_params" target="_blank"> [FIGURE] </a> for setting dynamic parameters defined in a CSV file (data.csv). 
				All the analysis where the probe subscription is enabled will have the dynamic parameters defined after running this script on command line.
				Once set these parameters are visible in "Risk context" as "Dynamic probability parameters".
			</li>
			<li><strong>Setup impacts based on dynamic parameters. </strong>Once the dynamic parameters are set these parameters can be used as arithmetic expressions to define impacts for the given risk analysis
				Refer <a href="#_set_impacts_based_on_dynamic_params" target="_blank"> [FIGURE] </a>.</li>
